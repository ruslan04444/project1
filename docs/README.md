# Beers Vs Cocktails

## Summary:

For the beer fans, this application allows you to look up breweries based off of either their name, or the state; and then favorite ones you have visited to know which ones you enjoyed.  

For the cocktail fans, users can search up their favorite cocktails and find out just what goes into them and how to make them.  They can look up the cocktail using either the name of the cocktail, or searching based off of ingredients such as vodka or blue curacao.
